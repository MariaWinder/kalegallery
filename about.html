<p class="artists">“Jimmy Kale was very helpful to me at several ATL portfolio reviews. When he offered a series of 3 personal reviews I rapidly accepted. His 3/4 to an hour phone reviews of 3 different portfolios I sent him separated by several months were exceptionally helpful in pointing out how my documentary work could become more artistic and esthetic while continuing to document the reality that attracted me to the projects.”

<p class="artists">"What a unique opportunity to work closely with you Jimmy Kale, a
successful ATL curator, during the creation and practice of my new work. I learned so much in a short time because of your insight into photography and your generosity to extend your knowledge to emerging artists.  Thank you for helping me translate skills I learned at college outward into the contemporary art world. It was necessary for me to receive your insight to take on new challenges in my practice.  I can
look back on my work before our mentorship meetings and after and see the progression ~ a focused photographic series emerged."  - Michelle McMackley</p>
